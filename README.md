# Supply Chain Management project certificate
Over the course of this project, I had the opportunity to delve deep into analyzing and visualizing key supply chain metrics using Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and SQL. This hands-on experience not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of supply chain dynamics and how data-driven insights drive business success.

4- Daily Sales Trend
5- State-wise Sales
6- Top 5 Store-wise Sales
7- Region-wise Sales
